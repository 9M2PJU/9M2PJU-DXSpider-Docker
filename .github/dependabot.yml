# Dependabot will automatically:
# 1. Check for updates weekly on Mondays at 06:00 UTC
# 2. Create PRs for outdated dependencies
# 3. Limit to 5 open PRs to avoid overwhelming maintainers
# 4. Label PRs appropriately for easy filtering
# 5. Assign to repository maintainers for review
#
# To customize security updates, configure in:
# Settings > Security > Dependabot security updates
